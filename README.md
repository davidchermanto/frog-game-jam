# Flychase

Made for Frog Jam 2022 within 2 days and downloadable from [here](https://edenmystery.itch.io/flychase)!

## Gameplay
You are a frog. Your only goal is to survive. There is an abundance of flies all around you, but they all just seem to move too quickly. However, catching them is essential to keeping yourself saturated.

Attached is a YouTube video of the Demo Gameplay.

### Easy to get into. Hard to Master.
Clicking on a tile can have 2 effects - moving towards the tile, or eating the fly on the tile, depending on the current mode. To switch between leap mode and tongue mode, use SPACE.

*I gave this to a friend for playtesting. He scored 50% higher than me pretty much in his second run.*

### Race against the clock.
Your saturation diminishes every second. If you do not eat enough flies, you will perish. Eat flies to regain your saturation and score a lot of points.

### Dynamic Music.
You will get audio cures; the more starved you are, the more intense the music will get.
